DESCRIPTION:Trends in energy efficiency (increasing computations per KWh ou
 tpacing Moore's Law) have produced low-power CPUs that can perform general
 -purpose tasks on less and less energy.  Recent work exploits this trend b
 y powering CPUs solely on harvested energy\, sidestepping the inconvenienc
 e of batteries and enabling deeply embedded sensing.  My contributions foc
 us on making these energy-harvesting platforms useful for general-purpose 
 computation.  An automatic checkpointing system called Mementos insulates 
 computations from constant power failures by saving volatile state as powe
 r wanes.  A cryptographic storage system called CCCP safely outsources che
 ckpoint storage to untrustworthy infrastructure over a surprisingly cheap 
 radio link.  An implantable\, maintenance-free gatekeeper serves to protec
 t a wirelessly vulnerable medical device with a cryptographic protocol.  A
 n open-source simulator enables reproducible runs against recordings of fi
 ckle energy harvesting.  My key goal is to simplify the job of building sy
 stems on energy-harvesting computers.\n\n\nI will also describe recent wor
 k on power analysis.  How carefully did you inspect that power outlet at t
 he coffee shop?\n\n\nBio:\n\nBen Ransford is a Ph.D. candidate at the Univ
 ersity of Massachusetts Amherst\, where he studies low-power computing and
  applied security in the lab of Kevin Fu.  After graduating from Cornell i
 n 2001\, he spent six years co-founding a series of software startups.  A 
 savvy filler of forms\, he was an NSF Graduate Research Fellow for three y
 ears at UMass.  His work with fantastic UW collaborators has received "bes
 t paper" awards from the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (Oakland) 
 and ACM SIGCOMM.  He obsesses over tennis\, copyediting\, Scrabble\, and b
 rewing kombucha.

DESCRIPTION:Long-standing trends in the energy efficiency of computing prom
 ise an explosion in data collected from mobile sensors\, controls\, and po
 rtable computing devices.    This talk will describe the research that rev
 ealed those efficiency trends and the implications of those trends for our
  ability to understand and respond to the world around us.  The talk will 
 also summarize work in progress characterizing related trends in mobile co
 mmunications\, sensors\, batteries\, and energy harvesting.\n\nRelated art

DESCRIPTION:To efficiently access the knowledge contained in developer docu
 mentation and communication such as API tutorials and forum posts\, it is 
 useful to resolve the code elements contained in documents. This informati
 on allows us to pinpoint\, for example\, what few messages are discussing 
 an API element of interest in large document collections. Automatically re
 covering links between an API and learning resources is notoriously diffic
 ult due to the inherent ambiguity of unstructured natural language. Code e
 lements mentioned in documents are rarely fully qualified\, so readers nee
 d to understand the context in which a code element is mentioned. This tal
 k will present recent work to develop highly-accurate techniques for resol
 ving informal references to code elements in developer documentation\, and
  the applications that such techniques support.\n Martin's page\n

DESCRIPTION:We are developing a new system for large-scale data analysis --
  called "Naiad" -- which has the goal of supporting complex iterative quer
 ies over dynamic inputs at interactive timescales. Like many existing syst
 ems\, Naiad supports high-level declarative queries\, data-parallel execut
 ion\, and transparent distribution. Unlike these systems\, Naiad can effic
 iently execute queries with multiple (possibly nested) iterative loops\, w
 hile simultaneously supporting low-latency incremental changes to the quer
 y inputs. As a highlight of its characteristics\, Naiad can not only effic
 iently compute the strongly connected component structure of a 24 hour sli
 ding window of the Twitter @mention graph (using a doubly nested fixed-poi
 nt computation)\, but also maintains the computation with sub-second laten
 cies in the face of Twitter's full volume of continuously arriving tweets.
 \n \nI will describe the computational model underlying Naiad\, a generali
 zation of traditional incremental dataflow to partially ordered logical ti
 mes\, and work through some of the (very friendly\, picture oriented) math
 ematical details. I will also highlight several new distributed systems ch
 allenges faced in order to fully realize the multiple orders-of-magnitude 
 performance improvements Naiad presents.\n\nThis is joint work with Derek 
 Murray\, Rebecca Isaacs\, Michael Isard and Martin Abadi.

DESCRIPTION:Today's software is full of bugs and finding them takes lots of
  effort.\nThis talk is about detecting bugs in an automatic and precise wa
 y.\nAutomatic means that the approach requires no input but the software u
 nder test (no specifications\, no hand-written tests). Precise means that 
 all reported warnings are indeed correctness problems (no false positives)
 .\nAt first\, we present an analysis to find classes that violate API prot
 ocols. Such protocols impose constraints on the order in which clients can
  call API methods. Violating API protocols leads to unexpected behavior\, 
 such as a program crash. The analysis automatically infers and checks API 
 protocols by leveraging generated tests in two ways: Passing tests drive t
 he program during protocol mining\, and failing test executions are checke
 d against the mined protocols. The analysis reports 54 API protocol violat
 ions in ten well-tested Java programs.\nThen\, we present an analysis to t
 est thread-safe classes. The key idea is to generate concurrent tests in w
 hich multiple threads call methods of a shared instance of the tested clas
 s. If a concurrent test exhibits an exception or a deadlock that cannot be
  triggered in any linearized execution of the test\, the analysis reports 
 a thread safety violation.\nThe analysis finds various bugs in popular Jav
 a libraries\, including two previously unknown bugs in the Java standard l
 ibrary.\n\nBio:\nMichael Pradel is a PhD student at ETH Zurich. His primar
 y research interests are in the area of software engineering and programmi
 ng languages. In particular\, he is interested in automated program analys
 es for finding programming errors. Michael graduated in computer science a
 t Technical University in Dresden\, Germany. He also spent two years at Ec
 ole Centrale Paris\, France\, where he became a graduate engineer\, and vi
 sited EPFL\, Switzerland\, to pursue his master thesis.\n

DESCRIPTION:Crowdsourcing contests have been popularized by the Netflix cha
 llenge and websites like TopCoder and Taskcn. What is a crowdsourcing cont
 est?  Imagine you are designing a new web service\, you have it all coded 
 up\, but the site looks bad because you haven't got any graphic design ski
 lls.  You could hire an artist to design your logo\, or you could post the
  design task as a competition to crowdsourcing website Taskcn with a monet
 ary reward of $100. Contestants on Taskcn would then compete to produce th
 e best logo. You then select your favorite logo and award that contestant 
 the $100 prize.\n\n In this talk\, I discuss the theory of crowdsourcing c
 ontests.  First\, I will show how to model crowdsourcing contests using au
 ction theory.\nSecond\, I will discuss how to solve for contestant strateg
 ies.  I.e.\, suppose you were entering such a programming contest on TopCo
 der\, how much work should you do on your entry to optimize your gains fro
 m winning less the cost of doing the work?  Finally\, I will discuss ineff
 iciency from the fact that the effort of losing contestants is wasted (e.g
 .\, every contestant has to do work to design a logo\, but you only value 
 your favorite logo).  I will show that this wasted effort is at most half 
 of the total amount of effort.  A consequence is that crowdsourcing is app
 roximately as efficient a means of procurement as conventional methods (e.
 g.\, auctions or negotiations).
